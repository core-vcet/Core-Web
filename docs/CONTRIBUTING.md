## 🌿 Git & Branching Workflow

We follow a structured Git branching strategy to keep `main` stable at all times.

### Branch Naming Conventions
- `feature/<short-description>`: New features (e.g., `feature/event-registration`, `feature/project-cards`)
- `fix/<short-description>`: Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/auth-cookie-expiry`, `fix/navbar-mobile-toggle`)
- `docs/<short-description>`: Documentation changes (e.g., `docs/api-guide`)
- `refactor/<short-description>`: Code restructuring without feature changes
- `chore/<short-description>`: Maintenance tasks and dependency updates

### Branching Commands
```bash
# Ensure your local main is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/event-registration
```

## 📝 Commit Guidelines (Conventional Commits)

We enforce clear, descriptive commit messages adhering to the **Conventional Commits** specification:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <short description in imperative mood>
```

### Common Types:
- `feat`: A new user-facing feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect code meaning (formatting, spacing)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `perf`: Code changes improving performance
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests
- `chore`: Build process, dependencies, or tool configurations

### Examples:
- `feat(events): add CSV participant export for organizers`
- `fix(auth): handle expired session token redirect`
- `docs: update setup instructions in README.md`

## 🚀 Pull Request (PR) Process

1. **Keep PRs Focused:** Aim for small, single-purpose pull requests. Large, monolithic PRs take longer to review.
2. **Run Linting & Tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run test # once tests are implemented
   ```
3. **Open a PR with Details:**
   - Clearly describe **what** was changed and **why**.
   - Attach before/after screenshots or screen recordings for UI changes.
   - Reference related issues using keywords (e.g., `Closes #12`).
4. **Code Review & Learning:**
   - At least one approval is required before merging.
   - Code reviews are a learning opportunity: communicate constructively, ask questions, and be respectful.
5. **No Direct Pushes to `main`:** All code lands on `main` through reviewed and approved Pull Requests.
